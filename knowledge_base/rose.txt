Category: Ideal Growing Conditions

Roses grow best in temperatures between 15°C and 30°C.
They require at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.
Ideal soil for roses is well-drained loamy soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5.
Roses prefer moderate humidity; extremely dry or extremely humid conditions can stress the plant.
Overwatering can cause root rot, while underwatering leads to wilting and yellowing leaves.
